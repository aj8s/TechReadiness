# What this is all about?
I have been enrolled into this Tech Readiness Anchor program by my employer to be able to reach the architect level in my role as a DevOps Engineer. 
I have task at my hand to learn several topics and be a star problem solver / architect. 
These 3 months will decide how my tech journey will be from here onwards. 
I'll see - If I am able to clear the Anchor Program with the expectations my employer has.
